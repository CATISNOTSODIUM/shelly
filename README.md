# Shelly - the interactive shell that tracks your statistics

Shelly is an interactive shell that tracks irrelevant information, such as
typing speed and most used commands.

## Checklist

- [/] Simple command without arguments
- [ ] Command with at least one arguments


Upon running commands, we also update the statistics by using `State::instrument`.
